Data Wrangling and EDA for NLP Workloads using Python
Dive into the world of text data with this project, where I take you through the journey of preparing and analyzing text-based datasets for natural language processing (NLP) tasks.

Dataset Preparation:

Chose a text-based dataset from Kaggle, such as customer reviews or social media posts.

Cleaned the data by removing special characters, stopwords, and performing stemming/lemmatization to make it ready for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Created engaging visualizations like word clouds, n-gram frequency plots, and sentiment distribution graphs to uncover the hidden stories in the data.

Highlighted the most interesting insights, patterns, and trends discovered along the way.

Feature Refinement for Modeling:

Used powerful techniques like vectorization (Bag of Words, TF-IDF) and embeddings to transform the text into numerical formats perfect for machine learning models.

Carefully selected a refined set of features for modeling, with a clear explanation of why these features were chosen.

This project is a comprehensive guide for anyone looking to tackle text data in NLP, from cleaning and exploring the data to refining features for modeling.
